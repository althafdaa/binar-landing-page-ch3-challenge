## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Slicing from Figma

### What I Learned

Positioning is hard and i rely too much on flex-box when i can easily combine it with grid and get the same result without thinking about margin padding too much to make sure the white space exist.
grid row col 12 is really game changer.

### Continued Development

Will add "GAME SUIT" later in next chapter probably starting in January
